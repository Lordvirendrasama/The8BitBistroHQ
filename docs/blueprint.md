## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Red (#EF0035) to align with the 8 Bit Bistro brand identity and evoke a sense of retro gaming.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F2F2F2) to provide a clean backdrop and high contrast with the red and black elements.
- Accent color: Pixel Green (#1FF202) to highlight key actions and rewards, in keeping with the pixel art theme.
- Pixelated headings: 'Karmatic Arcade' for the brand name and prominent headings, in pixel style as specified.
- Main Headings & Body Text: 'Anton' for its clear and friendly sans-serif appearance.
- Use strict pixel art motifs, as specified by the 8 Bit Bistro Brand Style Guide. Consider Space Invaders, game consoles, and pixelated versions of coffee cups and board game elements.
- Implement a clean, well-defined layout with balanced asymmetry and organic shapes in dynamic red. Incorporate plenty of whitespace to prevent a cluttered feel.
